I just got this idea and implemented, this given me good results

In burp, go to target --> engagements tool --> Find comments --> save them to a file.

Now use gpt or ai, and give this prompt

"you are a professional bughunter, Please analyze the following comments that I've collected using BurpSuite's engagement tools. 
Identify and highlight any sensitive information that might be present in the uploaded comments file"

--> In the similar way, you can also do by collecting scripts
And write a prompt such that it will identify the logic of the js, reconstruct the urls from the paths etc, good prompt writing entirely depends on your creativity.
