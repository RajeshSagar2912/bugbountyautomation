First of all for subdomain enumeration I use this tool called sudomy https://github.com/screetsec/Sudomy, with most of the api keys configured. So below are some more resources. To be ahead in the game.


1) Collecting subdomains from GitHub

https://github.com/gwen001/github-subdomains

--> github-subdomains -d target.com -t your_github_token 

2) Collecting subdomains from Cloud

https://github.com/Spix0r/cloudrecon

--> ./main.sh -u -s target.com

3) collecting subdomains from leakix 

--> curl -H 'accept: application/json' "https://leakix.net/api/subdomains/$target" | jq -r '.[].subdomain' 

Here is the bash script to automate these three:

'''
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for the target domain
read -p "Enter the target domain: " target

# Fetch subdomains from LeakIX and save to leakix_subs.txt
curl -H 'accept: application/json' "https://leakix.net/api/subdomains/$target" | jq -r '.[].subdomain' > leakix_subs.txt

echo "collected subs from leakix"

# Fetch subdomains from GitHub using github-subdomains tool and save to github_subs.txt
github-subdomains -d $target -t your_github_token

echo "collected subs from github"

# Run the cloud_recon.sh script to find cloud subdomains and save to cloud_subs.txt
./cloud_recon.sh -s $target > cloud_subs.txt

echo "collected subs from cloud and combining them into a single file"

# Combine all subdomain lists into collected_subs.txt
cat leakix_subs.txt cloud_subs.txt $target.txt | sort -u  > collected_subs.txt

# Remove intermediate files
rm leakix_subs.txt cloud_subs.txt $target.txt

echo "Subdomain enumeration completed. Results saved in collected_subs.txt"
